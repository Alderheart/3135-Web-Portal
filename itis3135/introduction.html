				<li>Personal background: I was born in Cary, NC, and grew up here as well. I'm in Charlotte for school and potentially for my career, but my heart will always be with Cary and my hometown. I love cats but I am extremely allergic. I refuse to stop petting them.
				</li>
				<li>Professional: Worked in highschool briefly for fast food just to get some experience. Otherwise, I'm currently purusing an internship in the field so that I may potentially get a professional computer science job someday.
				</li>
				<li>Academic background: I graduated Green Hope Highschool in 2019. I am currently attending the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and will graduate in 2023.</li>
				<li>Background in the subject matter of this course: My major is Computer Science, with a concentration in software development. I've done plenty of workshops and personal projects regarding application development and would like more experience.</li>
				<li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10.</li>
				<li>Courses I'm taking and reason for each: 
					<ul>
						<li>ITCS 3160 - Database Design and Implementation: Many of my personal and professional projects require the knowledge of databases, and I think this can help me fill out areas of my knowledge that I still need.</li>
						<li>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design and Development: I'm a big fan of the cross-platform nature of web applications, and I think this course can help me realize some of my goals.</li>
						<li>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info Security and Privacy: One thing I've realized as my projects has grown is that there will always be malicious actors seeking to harm you and your project. As a result, cybersecurity is of utmost importance for me.</li>
						<li>ITSC 3146 - Intro to Operation Systems and Networking: I think this is a great course to lay some foundational knowledge for my career.</li>
						<li>ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering: This course is extremely relevant to my future career and it's very important to me that I take it.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
					The fastest I ever went on water was 35 mph.
					</li>
				<li>I'd also like to share:
					I hope ITIS 3135 will be a big help in filling out holes in my knowledge about web development!</li>
