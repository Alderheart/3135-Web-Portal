				<h3><a href='https://www.art.yale.edu/' target='_blank'>CRAP: Yale School of Art</a></h3>
				
				<p class='description'>
				<b>The official landing page of the Yale School of Art. The<br>
				reason this website looks the way it does is because it<br>
				can be edited by anyone and everyone.</b>
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
					<b>Contrast:</b> Contrast and color theory is essentially nonexistent.<br>
					Randomly chosen colors clash with each other in a way that<br>
					could only happen if this lack of contrast was intended. The gradients<br>
					should be removed and all text should have a darker background.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
					<b>Repetition:</b> The entire page is highly repetitive. Information and<br>
					buttons are laid out in lists with the entire background <br>
					being a repeating looped gif. The background should be removed<br>
					and text could be organized differently.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
					<b>Alignment:</b> There seems to be some semblance of alignment as elements<br>
					are ordered around the central gray block. However, it seems the <br>
					website ran out of content as all of the elemnts are shoved to the left<br>
					side. Instead, elements could be spread out more.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
					<b>Proximity:</b> Proximity is terrible, elements are way to close together,<br>
					and there is a huge chunk of unused space on the left. Like mentioned in<br>
					alignment, text should be spread out more.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3><a href='https://serverjars.com/' target='_blank'>GOOD: ServerJars</a></h3>
				
				<p class='description'>
				<b>ServerJars is a third party website that hosts large amounts of mirror<br>
				links for Bukkit, Paper, Spigot, and other server files.<br></b>
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
					<b>Contrast:</b> Contrast is good. The website utilizes dark and light areas to<br>
					direct your eyes towards the important information on the page. Intuitive<br>
					direct your eyes towards the important information on the page. Intuitive<br>
					and well designed.
					</li>
					<li>
					<b>Repetition:</b> Repetition is used in a way that is logical and breaks the website<br>
					into sections that are easy to understand at a glance.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
					<b>Alignment:</b> Alignment is great, with elements centered to bring them to your<br>
					attention. Each column represents a category of server files and helps you<br>
					quickly find what you're looking for.
					</li>
					<li>
					<b>Proximity:</b> Proximity is good. Elements are spaced apart so that they don't <br>
					conflict with each other's space yet is cohesive enough that it's obvious<br>
					when something is in the same section.
					</li>
				</ul>
